# Bunbot - Simple Shoutcast Bot!

Bunbot is a Java-based bot designed to play Shoutcast v2 and some Icecast streams. It supports the following commands:
- `!play`: Start playing the stream.
- `!leave`: Leave the voice channel.
- `!refresh`: Refresh the stream list.
- `!song`: Display the current song playing.

Please note that Bunbot will no longer receive updates. Future developments and improvements will be made to the version written in Python, which can be found [here](https://github.com/CGillen/BunBotPython).
